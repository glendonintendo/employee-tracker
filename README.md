## Description
The Employee Tracker is a command line application that prompt the user to view, add, update, and delete data from an employees database. 
## Technologies Used
- inquirer: used to prompt the user with questions and get data objects to send to server
- express: used to create and implement a local server
- dotenv: used to hide private login information for mysql
- console.table: used to create prettier tables in the command line
- mysql: used for database management
- node-fetch: used to fetch apis from node
- nodemon: used to automatically reload server when server files have been edited (dev)

## Usage
The application uses mysql, so it is required to have my ql installed before attempting the next steps.

To create your database and table, run `SOURCE db/db.sql;` and `SOURCE db/schema.sql` from mysql. To populate the table with test data, `SOURCE db/seeds.sql` can be used as well.

From the command line, start the server with the command `npm start`. Then, from a separate command line, use the command `node index.js` to start the application.
## Demo
A demo video of my deployed application can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsWZeFcuSV4).

My data tables are structured similar to the diagram below:
